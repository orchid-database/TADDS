# Oxford-RCGP RSC TADDS (Themes, Access, Dynamics Data Services) to support surveillance, quality improvement, research and educational (SQuIRE) studies

## ORCHID Dynamic Data Services (ORCHID-DDS)
* In addition to Themed and Customised datasets (paragraphs 2 & 3) the Clinical Informatics and Health Outcomes (CIHO) research group provide Dynamic Digital Data services to support SQUIRE studies (D3S4)
* Whist the Themed and Customised dataset are essentially static (even if refreshed regularly) the ORCHID-DDS are refreshed at predetermined intervals, from near real time to week.
* ORCHID-DDS can also have planned bespoke extractions to fit with study protocols.  These bespoke extracts might be defined in terms of study landmarks e.g. baseline, mid-study, end of study; or defined by date or time interval.
* The component clinical data will all be initially defined within our Themed or Customised datasets.  The ORCHID-DDS will provide a framework for their extraction and use.  

## ORCHID - Themed datasets

* We have >1,700 general practices in our network that can provide data for routine data analysis. 
* Our theme datasets are accessible for research within a short turnaround time (subject to ethical approval being granted)
* Our themed datasets my also be enhanced by linkage. 

## ORCHID - Customised datasets:
* For customised datasets, our team of clinical informaticians can support researchers to develop clinical code specifications for study variables.   


## Periodically updated interactive data visualisations
We offer two types of web based interactive data visualisations: 
*	Observatories (for network level data analytics)
*	Dashboards (for practice level data analytics)

Observatories/ dashboards are developed according to a data specification and user interface specification provided by the funder. 

Observatories/dashboards will  be designed to conform to standard user interface guidelines published by Oxford RCGP RSC to ensure familiarity to participating practices.

Once signed off by the funder, observatories/dashboards are incorporated in to the routine data refresh process.  Based on the availability of data observatories/ dashboards can be refreshed:
*	Monthly
*	Weekly
*	Twice weekly or
*	Daily.

## Qualitative data collection
Oxford-RCGP RSC is capable of collecting data for qualitative studies from participating general practices. 
*	Practice based questionnaires: We are able to provide access to various practice roles (including general practitioners, nurses, health care assistants, practice manager). We are also able to arrange various practice roles to participate in interviews/ focus groups. 
*	Patient questionnaires: We are able to advertise studies in practices and recruit patients for questionnaire based studies. General practitioners in participating practices are able to actively recruit suitable participants for studies by identifying patients from the general practice computerised medical record system.
